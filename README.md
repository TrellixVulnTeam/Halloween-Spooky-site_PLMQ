Halloween website created from youtube channel Bedimcode

Instead of just using CSS, I used Sass as my CSS compiler. 
While using Sass I was able to create multiple components of every styling object. 
In my main.scss I loaded all the different scss files and output it in my styles.css

Below you can find the end result of this project.
